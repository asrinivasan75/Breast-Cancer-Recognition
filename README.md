# Breast-Cancer-Recognition
Takes a list of attributes and returns whether the cancer is malignant or benign.

This model utilizes a relu and sigmoid function in order to obtain higher accuracy. The relu function is the input dimension, while the output dimension is sigmoid as it returns a binary value. In addition, for data visualization, I used a tensorboard to show epoch loss and accuracy change. The final accuracy was 97% when tested using 2000 epochs.
